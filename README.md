## Overview
BadgerChatGPT is an interactive generative AI chat app where users can talk to AI personas in real time. The app supports multiple AI personalities (or "personas") and remembers conversations between sessions using localStorage.

Built using modern React and Bootstrap, this project demonstrates prompt engineering, streaming AI response handling, and frontend UX persistence techniques.
